CREATING AN ACCOUNT

On the home page, you are only allowed to create a customer account. This is to prevent anyone from being able to 
manipulate things that they don't have clearance for. As such, only administrators who navigate to the "users" page
will be able to create either chef or adminstrator accounts. 


PLACING AN ORDER

This functionality is only available to customer accounts. To place an order, choose which of the toppings available
that you want. You cannot move on to the next page unless you pick one of the items, except for the page that says, 
"Top it off with toppings." You are allowed to have as many or none of the toppings that you want. When you're done,
click "Submit Order." A pop-up will tell you that your order has been received.


MANAGING THE QUEUE

This functionality is only available to chef accounts. On the "queue" screen, there will be a list of orders that need
to be prepared. When they are prepared, simply clicking anywhere inside of the order will cause it to be "bumped" from
the queue. Mobile users will be notified that their order is complete when this is done. On the right side, there is a
simple list of the main ingredients for each item in the queue so that preparation can be streamlined. The "recall" 
button on the lower right will rescind the last order that was bumped, and place it back into its position in the queue.
If there are more than 8 orderrs, than the arrows on the lower right can be used to scroll through and view them all.


MANAGING INGREDIENTS

This functionality is available to both chef and administartor accounts. 

As a chef: Navigate to the "availability" page. Turn on or off any of the ingredients by clicking on the blue sliders. 
This will automatically update the menu to let users know that the chosen ingredients are currently out of stock and 
are unable to be ordered.

As an administrator: Navigate to the "menu" page. Turn on or off any of the ingredients by clicking the "available"
checkbox next to the ingredient. You can choose which type of ingredients to view by using the navigation bar on the
left side. In addition to making an ingredient available or not, the ingredient can be totally deleted by using the 
"x" button to the right of the ingredient. A pop-up will ask to confirm if you are sure that you want it to be deleted.
You can also choose to add ingredients by using the text-field to the right. Type in the name of the ingredient, and
specify which type of ingredient you want this to be specified as.

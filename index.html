         <h2><a id="about">About Me</a></h2>
         <p>I was born on May 12, 1955. I was raised on a farm by my parents, Mona and Abraham
         Simpson. In the mid-1960s, while I was between nine and twelve years old, Mona went into
         hiding following a run-in with the law. I attended Springfield High School and fell in
         love with Marge Bouvier in 1974. Marge became pregnant with Bart in 1979, while I was 
         working at a miniature golf course. We were wed in a small wedding chapel across the 
         state line. From there we spent our wedding reception alone at a truck stop, and the 
         remainder of our wedding night at Marge's parents' house. After failing to get a job at 
         the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, I left Marge to find a job by which I could support 
         my family. I briefly worked at a taco restaurant called the Gulp n' Blow, until Marge 
         found me and convinced me to return. As a result, I confronted Mr. Burns and secured a 
         job at the Plant. Marge became pregnant with Lisa in 1981, shortly before we bought our 
         first house. In 1985 and 1986, I saw brief success as the lead singer and songwriter for 
         the barbershop quartet the Be Sharps, even winning a Grammy. During my time with the 
         group, I was frequently absent from home, which put stress on my marriage. After the 
         group broke up due to creative differences, I went back to Springfield to continue my old 
         life. Sometime in the late 1980s, I and Marge carefully budgeted so I could have my dream 
         job as a pin monkey in a bowling alley. Unfortunately for me, Marge became pregnant with 
         Maggie shortly after I started my new job, and not being able to support my family, I 
         went back to the Nuclear Plant.</p>
